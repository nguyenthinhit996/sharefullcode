Java is a programming language and a platform.
Java is an object-oriented. class-based, concurrent, secured, general-purposed.
Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs. it knows as a platform.
Java has JRE (java runtime environment) and API, it is called a platform.

Java can use apply into many places:
Application Desktop: such as Acrobat reader, Media player, antivirus.
Web Application: javatpoint.com, nasa, Wikipedia Search
Enterprise Application: banking, production process.
Mobile: Spotify, Twitter, Opera mini
Embedded System
Start Card
Robotics
Games: Minecraft

-------------------------------------- Type of java -------------------------------------------------

Type of java:

Java SE (Standard Editor): Standard lone applications are also knows desktop application or window-based applications.
It include java programming API such as java.io, java.lang, java.util, java.sql . It includes core topics OPPs, String,
Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

Java EE (Enterprise Editor): It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise application.
it is build on top java SE. it include servlet, jsp, web services, JPA, ...

Java ME(Java Micro Edition): It is micro platform serve for to mobile development.

Java Fx:The GUI library it is used to develop rich internet application.  It can many devices such as desktop, web, phone, tivi, tablet.
The Java Fx is can extend from Swing.

#question: What is difference between JDK, JRE, JVM:

JVM: this is an abstract machine. It is call virtual machine because not physical exists.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which java code can be executed.
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and complied to java bytecode.
JVM action: Load Code, Verifies code, Execute code, Provides runtime environment.

JRE: Java runtime environment, it is a set of software tools which are used for developing java application.
contain JVM and some library + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

JDK: Java Development Kit. it is a development environment which is used to develop java application and applets.
It contain JRE + development tools + a few other resource such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac),
an archiver (jar) and a doc generator (javadoc).

Heap vs stack:
heap: lưu trữ biến primitive, biến (con trỏ) trỏ đến object lưu bên stack.
Stack: thực sự lưu trưc biến reference, và string pool

Version Java: đang sử dụng java 11 , new version là java march 18 2022

-------------------------------------- Feature of java -------------------------------------------------

Feature of java:

Simple: it is very to learn, clean and easy to understand, java has removed many complicated and rarely-used feature.
explicit pointer. We dont need to remove unreference object because there is an automatic Garbage Collection in java.

Object oriented: Java is an oriented language programming. everything in java is an object.
Object-oriented is meaning we organize our software as a combination of difference types of object that incorporate
both data and behavior.

OOP (object oriented programming) of java include below:
Object:
Class:
Inheritance:
Polymorphism:
Abstraction:
Encapsulation:

Platform independent: Java is write once, run anywhere. Windown, Linux, MacOs.
Java code can be executed on multiple platforms. Java code is complied by the compiler and converted into bytecode .
this bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run multiple platforms.

Secured: Java is best known for security. because:
No explicit pointer, Java programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
,Classloader in java is a part of the java runtime environment, which is used to load java classes into the
the java Virtual machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local
file system form those that are imported from network sources.
Bytecode verifier: It checks the code fragment for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
Example : c/c++ run directly on os environment whereas java run on JVM evn not os evn.

Architecture-neutral: Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent feature, for example
types is fixed.

Portable: Java is portable because it facilities you to carry the java bytecode to any platform.

High performance: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming language because the bytecode of java is close
with native code. It is still a little bit slower than a complied language (c or c++). Java is an interpreted language that
why it is slower than complied language like c c++.

Distributed: Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed application in java.
RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications .this feature of java makes us able to access by calling the
methods from any machine on the internet.

Multi-threaded: A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write java programs that deal with
many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main of advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy
memory for each thread. it shared a common memory area.

Dynamic: Java is dynamic language. it supports the dynamic loading of classes. it mean classes are loaded on demand.
supports functions for it native languages i.e C and C++.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java is always pass-by-value


--------------------------------------- Detail in run program ------------------------------------------------
At complied:
convert from file.java compiler to file.class

At Runtime:
class file -> classloader -> bytecode verified -> interpreted -> runtime -> hardware.
classloader: It is a subsystem of JVM that is used to load class file.
bytecode verified: Check the code fragment for illegal that can access right to object.
Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.


#question: Can you save a java source file by another name than class name: yes if the class not public
#question: Can have multi class in on file.java: yes

---------------------------------------  Variable Java ------------------------------------------------
there are three variables in java.
local variable , instance variable, static variable.
local variable : use in body of method and can not defined as static variable in case local variable.
instance variable: use inside class but outside method and not declared with key static.
it called instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances. static variable
static variable: same way declared with instance variable but declared together with key static. we can shared
variable among instances. memory allocation for static only one happens only once when the class is loaded.
* notice: we can similar name local variable with instance and static, but
in method will get localVariable.

---------------------------------------  Data type Java ------------------------------------------------

Have two data type in java:
Primitive data types: boolean (1 byte) , char (1 byte), byte (1 byte),
short (2 byte), int (4 byte), long(8 byte), float (4 byte), double(8 byte).
Non primitive data types: non primitive data type and String, classes, interfaces, arrays.

Primitive Default and min max value:

1 byte = 8 bit
1 bit it aware sinal (dấu âm hoặc dương).
khi max phải trừ đi 1 số vì trừ đi 1 con sô đó là số 0.

                    default             min                 max
 boolean (1 byte):  false               -                   -
 char (1 byte)   :  '\u0000' (null)
 byte (1 byte)   :  0   2^7=-128                            2^7 = 128 - 1 (subtract - zero) = 127
short (2 byte)   :  0   2^15=-32,768                        2^15 -1 = 32,767
int (4 byte)     :  0   2^31=- 2,147,483,648                2^31 -1 = 2,147,483,647
 long(8 byte)    :  0   2^63=-9,223,372,036,854,775,808     2^63 - 1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
 float (4 byte)  :  0   single precision 32 bit
 double(8 byte)  :  0   double precision 64 bit
